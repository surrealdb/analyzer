"""Triage gate for the real-world corpus.

The corpus is NOT all-valid — it contains genuinely broken SurrealQL. So holding
the finding *count* flat is the wrong invariant, and an actively harmful one: it
pressures a change toward suppressing a correct new diagnostic rather than
recording it. That is not hypothetical. Gating aggregate promotion on a GROUP
clause was declined purely because it would add +2 findings here, even though the
engine rejects both of those queries outright:

    SELECT VALUE math::sum(size_bytes) FROM file WHERE ...
    -> Incorrect arguments for function math::sum(). Expected `array<number>`
       but found `10`

The invariant that actually matters: **every finding is accounted for**. New
findings are fine — they must be triaged and recorded with a verdict. A finding
that DISAPPEARS is equally interesting, because a check that stopped firing is
usually a regression, and a bare count hides that entirely (one gained + one lost
looks identical to no change).
