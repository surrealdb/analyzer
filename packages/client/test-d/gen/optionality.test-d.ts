// One SurrealQL `option<string>`, two TypeScript spellings — and a proof that

// position it is rendering into.
//
// `nick` is `option<string>`. The two registry rows below came from the same
// `Kind`; the only difference is where it sits:
//
//   SELECT name, nick FROM person             → Array<{ name: string; nick?: string }>
//   SELECT VALUE nick FROM ONLY person:jane   → undefined | string
//
// The Rust side pins those exact rows in `crates/codegen/src/typescript.rs`
// (`an_optional_field_and_an_optional_result_spell_differently`); this file
// pins what `tsc` then makes of them.
//
// Pure type checks — `main` is never called, so no connection opens.
