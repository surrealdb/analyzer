/**
 * `preload` — server-fetched data that *remembers which query it is*.
 *
 * This is the piece that removes the redesign's biggest structural flaw. In 0.4
 * the SSR seed and the component each spelled out the same query text, and if
 * they ever drifted by one byte the cache key stopped matching: the seed was
 * silently discarded, the page refetched, and nothing — no error, no warning, no
 * type failure — said so.
 *
 * A {@link Preloaded} payload carries the key, the text and the parameters
 * alongside the data, so the component reconstructs the subscription from the
 * payload and the text appears exactly once, in `queries.ts`.
 *
 * ```ts
 * // +page.ts
 * export const load = async () => ({ people: await preload(db, livePeople) });
 * ```
 * ```svelte
 * <script lang="ts">
 *   let { data } = $props();
 *   const people = createLive(data.people);   // no query text here at all
 * </script>
 * ```
 *
 * The payload is a plain object of plain values: it survives SvelteKit's
 * devalue and a React Server Component's props boundary without a transport
 * hook, which is why the whole reactive layer is {@link Json}-shaped.
