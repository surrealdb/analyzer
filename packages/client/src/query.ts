/**
 * A query is a value, not a string.
 *
 * ```ts
 * // src/lib/queries.ts — the one place query text lives
 * import { db } from "./db";   // `createClient<Queries>(…)`
 *
 * export const allPeople = db.defineQuery("SELECT id, name, age FROM person");
 * export const peopleOf  = db.defineQuery("SELECT id, name FROM person WHERE team = $team");
 * export const livePeople = db.defineLive("SELECT id, name, age FROM person");
 * ```
 *
 * The free `defineQuery` / `defineLive` exported here resolve against the
 * *global* {@link SurqlRegistry} instead, which is empty unless the user
 * augments it. `db.defineQuery` is bound to the client's own registry and
 * needs no augmentation, so it is the one to reach for; destructure it once
 * (`export const { defineQuery, defineLive } = db`) and the call sites look
 * identical.
 *
 * `defineQuery<Q extends string>(text: Q)` is the same inference site as
 * `db.query<Q extends string>(query: Q, …)`: TypeScript infers `Q` as the string
 * literal, one conditional generic reads {@link SurqlRegistry}, and there is no
 * permissive `string` overload. The literal is simply written *once*, in a
 * module, instead of once per consumer — which is what stops an SSR seed and a
 * component from drifting apart byte-for-byte with no error and no warning.
 *
 * The returned {@link SurqlQuery} carries `text`, `params` and a stable `key` as
 * real runtime fields; the result and parameter types ride along as phantoms, in
 * the same spirit as gql.tada's `TadaDocumentNode`.
