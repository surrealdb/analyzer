/**
 * The query registry — the contract between `surrealkit generate` and this
 * client.
 *
 * `surrealkit generate` emits a module augmentation that adds one entry per
 * analyzed query, keyed by the exact query text:
 *
 * ```ts
 * declare module "@surrealdb/analyzer-client" {
 *   interface SurqlRegistry {
 *     "SELECT * FROM user": {
 *       result: [Array<{ id: RecordId<"user">; name: string }>];
 *       params: Record<string, never>;
 *     };
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * A base (empty) interface lives here so `defineQuery` and `db.query` can key
 * on `keyof SurqlRegistry`; the generated file only ever adds entries. Every
 * lookup is one conditional generic on a literal type parameter — there is no
 * permissive `string` overload anywhere on the path, because a literal is also
 * a `string` and a fallback overload would rescue every mis-call.
