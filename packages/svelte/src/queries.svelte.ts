/**
 * `createQuery` / `createLive` — Svelte 5 reactive primitives over the reactive
 * core.
 *
 * The returned object exposes `data` / `status` / `loading` / `error` as
 * **getters**, so you read them directly in markup with no `$` prefix and
 * reading tracks. That shape was already right in 0.4 and is kept.
 *
 * Two things are new and they are the point of the rewrite:
 *
 * 1. **A `Source<Q>` thunk keeps params reactive.** 0.4 read `{ params }` once,
 *    at construction, so a query parameterised on `$derived` state could never
 *    re-run.
 * 2. **`createSubscriber`, not `$effect`.** `$effect` only runs inside a
 *    component, so sharing a query from a `.svelte.ts` module — the idiomatic
 *    Svelte 5 way to share reactive state — threw `effect_orphan` unless the
 *    caller wrapped it in `$effect.root` and managed disposal by hand.
 *    `createSubscriber` (svelte/reactivity, 5.7+) subscribes lazily on first
 *    read inside a tracking scope and tears down automatically, anywhere.
 *
 * ```svelte
 * <script lang="ts">
 *   import { page } from "$app/state";
 *   import { createLive, createQuery } from "@surrealdb/analyzer-svelte";
 *   import { allPeople, liveTeam } from "$lib/queries";
 *
 *   // re-subscribes whenever page.params.team changes; the old LIVE is KILLed
 *   const team = createLive(() => liveTeam.with({ team: page.params.team }));
 *   const roster = createQuery(allPeople);
 * </script>
 * ```
