/**
 * What `<Query>` / `<LiveQuery>` accept as `q`, and the rows that follow from it.
 *
 * Both components take a single type parameter, inferred straight off the `q`
 * prop, and read the row type back out of it here. That shape is deliberate: an
 * earlier version carried a second parameter for the value form and chose
 * between the two with a conditional type, but a conditional is not an inference
 * site, so nothing ever bound it and every snippet parameter degraded to
 * `unknown` — the exact annotation-at-the-call-site this exists to remove.
 *
 * The text form is constrained to `keyof SurqlRegistry`, so a query the
 * generated registry does not know is a type error **on the attribute**, where
 * the mistake is, rather than a silent `unknown` downstream. Reformatting a
 * query changes its text and therefore its key, so this is the check that
 * catches an edit nobody thinks of as one — `surrealkit generate` picks the
 * new text up on its next run, and until it does, the build stops.
