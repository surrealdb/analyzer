  `<LiveQuery>` — a live query, rendered declaratively.

  A thin wrapper over `createLive`, and separate from `<Query>` on purpose: a
  `live` boolean prop would make one component's result type depend on a flag,
  and "is this array reconciled or fetched once?" is worth reading off the tag.

  ```svelte
  <Query q={allPeople}>
    {#snippet children(people)}
      {#each people as person (person.id)}
        <LiveQuery q={livePerson.with({ id: person.id })}>
          {#snippet children(rows)}{rows[0]?.name}{/snippet}
        </LiveQuery>
      {/each}
    {/snippet}
  </Query>
  ```

  Nesting one per row is the intended pattern, so the mount/unmount cost is the
  design constraint. It is cheap in both directions: mounting joins the
  refcounted cache entry for that key (N components on one key share one `LIVE
  SELECT`), and unmounting drops the last reference, which `KILL`s the
  subscription immediately — `createSubscriber` tears down as soon as nothing
  reads it, and a destroyed component reads nothing. A row scrolled out of view
  therefore stops costing a subscription.

  The snippet receives the reconciled **rows**, never the live-query `Uuid`. The
  uuid is a subscription handle, not a payload; a component that renders one has
  nothing useful to render. It is not exposed.

  Fallbacks match `<Query>`: absent `loading` renders nothing, absent `error`
  throws so the failure surfaces.
