  `<Query>` — a one-shot query, rendered declaratively.

  It is a thin wrapper over `createQuery`: the fetching, the shared cache and the
  refcounted teardown all still live in the reactive core. What the component
  adds is that a route can express "run this, show a spinner, show an error,
  render the rows" in markup, with the row type flowing into the snippet
  parameter and no annotation at the call site.

  ```svelte
  <Query q="SELECT id, name FROM team">
    {#snippet children(teams)}
      {#each teams as team (team.id)}<li>{team.name}</li>{/each}
    {/snippet}
  </Query>

  <Query q="SELECT id, name FROM person WHERE age > $min" params={{ min: minAge }}>
    {#snippet children(people)}…{/snippet}
  </Query>
  ```

  `q` is the query text, and it must be a query the generated registry knows —
  a string that is not in it is a type error naming the remedy, never a silent
  `unknown`. That is what types `children` with no annotation, and it is why the
  prop is not simply `string`.

  Parameters are passed as `params`, spelled the way SurrealQL spells them
  (`$min`). Nothing is interpolated into the text: the text is a constant, so it
  is one cache entry and one registry key however the parameters change, and a
  value can never be spliced into the query.

  `q` also takes the values the primitives take — a `SurqlQuery`, a `Preloaded`
  payload, a thunk of either, or `"skip"` — for a query named elsewhere.

  Fallbacks when a snippet is absent: no `loading` renders nothing (a spinner is
  the app's decision, not the library's); no `error` **throws**, so the failure
  reaches `<svelte:boundary>` or SvelteKit's error page instead of a page that is
  silently, permanently blank.
