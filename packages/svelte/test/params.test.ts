/**
 * A `<Query>` follows its parameters.
 *
 * The interesting case is the one that is easy to assume works: `params` is
 * read inside the same thunk as `q`, and that thunk runs inside a `$derived`,
 * so changing a parameter re-resolves the query and re-runs it. There is no
 * `reactive` opt-in because there is nothing to opt into.
