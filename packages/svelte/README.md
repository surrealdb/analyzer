# @surrealdb/analyzer-svelte

Svelte 5 / SvelteKit bindings for SurrealQL Analyzer.

**You may not need this package.** The typed client works in a component with
nothing around it — no provider, no wrapper, no helper:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { db } from "$lib/db";

  const rows = db.query("SELECT id, name, age, team FROM person");
</script>

{#await rows then [people]}
  <ul>
    {#each people as person (person.id)}
      <li>{person.name} — {person.age}</li>
    {/each}
  </ul>
{/await}
```

`person.name` is a `string`, `person.team` is a `RecordId<"team">` and
`person.nope` is a compile error, all inferred from your schema.

What this package adds is *reactive* state: a live query that re-renders as rows
change, a query whose parameters follow `$derived` state, an SSR payload a
component can pick up without naming the query twice — as runes
(`createQuery` / `createLive`) or as markup (`<Query>` / `<LiveQuery>`). Reach
for it when you want one of those.

## Setup

Three steps, and skipping any of them yields `any` with no error on your own
code — see [When everything is `any`](#when-everything-is-any).

**1. Install.** All three, including `@surrealdb/analyzer-client`: it is the
runtime (the generated file is types only) and the module the generated types
import their value classes from.

```sh
npm install @surrealdb/analyzer-svelte @surrealdb/analyzer-client surrealdb
cargo install surrealkit    # the command line: check, generate, watch
```

**2. Generate into `src/lib`,** so `$lib/surrealql-analyzer` resolves. Bare
`generate` writes to the workspace root, which is not where that import points:

```sh
surrealkit generate --out src/lib/surrealql-analyzer.d.ts
```

Put it in `package.json` so the path is written once:

```json
{ "scripts": { "generate": "surrealkit generate --out src/lib/surrealql-analyzer.d.ts" } }
```

Commit the generated file — it is what makes a fresh checkout type-check
without a build step. Re-run on every schema or query change, or leave
`--watch` running.

**3. Create the client once — and augment the registry.**

```ts
// src/lib/db.ts
import { createClient } from "@surrealdb/analyzer-client";
import type { Queries } from "$lib/surrealql-analyzer";

// `<Query q="SELECT …">` is a markup attribute: there is no call site to put a
// type argument on, so the components read the GLOBAL registry. This one line,
// in your own code, is what fills it.
declare module "@surrealdb/analyzer-client" {
  interface SurqlRegistry extends Queries {}
}

export const db = createClient<Queries>({
  url: "ws://localhost:8000/rpc",
  namespace: "app",
  database: "app",
});

export const { defineQuery, defineLive } = db;
```

Import `createClient` **from the generated file** — that import is what loads the
registry augmentation. The connection opens lazily, so a module-level `db` is
safe and nothing has to `await db.connect(...)`.

That is setup finished. `db.query`, `db.run` and `db.watch` now work from a plain
`import { db } from "$lib/db"` in any component, `load`, server route or `.ts`
module.

## `setClient` is not part of setup

It is easy to read the old docs and conclude the client has to be *provided*
before anything works. It does not. `setClient` exists for one thing: the
reactive helpers below (`createQuery`, `createLive`, `createMutation`) resolve
their client from Svelte context, so components do not thread `db` through
props.

```svelte
<!-- src/routes/+layout.svelte — only if you use the reactive helpers -->
<script lang="ts">
  import { setClient } from "@surrealdb/analyzer-svelte";
  import { db } from "$lib/db";

  setClient(db);
  let { children } = $props();
</script>

{@render children()}
```

Every helper also takes the client directly, which is the same thing without the
context hop — and it is what a `.svelte.ts` module must do anyway, since
`setContext` is only readable during component initialisation:

```ts
const people = createLive(livePeople, { client: db });
```

Use whichever you prefer. Neither is more typed than the other.

## Naming queries — for when two places must agree

`db.query("…")` takes the text inline. `defineQuery` / `defineLive` name it, and
what that buys is a *value* rather than any extra type safety — they read the
same registry through the same conditional generic. It matters when the same
query appears in two files, which is exactly the SSR case:

```ts
// src/lib/queries.ts
import { defineQuery, defineLive } from "$lib/db";

export const allPeople  = defineQuery("SELECT id, name, age, team FROM person");
export const addPerson  = defineQuery("CREATE person SET name = $name, age = $age, team = $team");
export const livePeople = defineLive("SELECT id, name, age, team FROM person");
export const liveTeam   = defineLive("SELECT id, name FROM person WHERE team = $team");
```

A live query needs a name in any case: `createLive` has to hold a reference to
re-subscribe with.

## `createLive` — a live query

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { createLive } from "@surrealdb/analyzer-svelte";
  import { livePeople } from "$lib/queries";

  const people = createLive(livePeople);
</script>

{#if people.error}
  <p class="error">{people.error.message}</p>
{:else}
  <ul>
    {#each people.data as person (person.id)}
      <li>{person.name}</li>
    {/each}
  </ul>
{/if}
```

`people.data` is ``Array<{ age: number; id: `person:${string}`; name: string; team: `team:${string}` }>``.
No `$` prefix — reading a getter tracks. `data` is always an array and starts
`[]`, so markup never needs `?? []`. N components sharing a query share one
`LIVE SELECT`, and the last one to unmount issues the `KILL`.

### Reactive parameters

**Wrap the query in a function.** A thunk re-runs when its dependencies change,
so the query re-subscribes:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { createLive } from "@surrealdb/analyzer-svelte";
  import { liveTeam } from "$lib/queries";
  import { RecordId } from "@surrealdb/analyzer-client";

  let { slug }: { slug: string } = $props();

  // when `slug` changes, the old subscription is KILLed and a new one opens
  const roster = createLive(() => liveTeam.with({ team: new RecordId("team", slug) }));
</script>
```

In a SvelteKit route `slug` is usually `page.params.team` from `$app/state` —
same rule, and the same reason it must be read *inside* the thunk. This is what
`@tanstack/svelte-query` v6 and `convex-svelte` both arrived at: *the argument
must be wrapped in a function to preserve reactivity*.

### Conditional queries

`"skip"` says "not yet", and keeps the row type:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { createLive } from "@surrealdb/analyzer-svelte";
  import { liveTeam } from "$lib/queries";
  import { RecordId } from "@surrealdb/analyzer-client";

  let { slug }: { slug: string | undefined } = $props();

  const roster = createLive(() =>
    slug ? liveTeam.with({ team: new RecordId("team", slug) }) : "skip",
  );
</script>
```

## `createQuery` — a one-shot query with loading and error state

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { createQuery } from "@surrealdb/analyzer-svelte";
  import { allPeople } from "$lib/queries";

  const roster = createQuery(allPeople);
</script>

{#if roster.loading}
  <p>Loading…</p>
{:else if roster.error}
  <p>{roster.error.message}</p>
{:else}
  <ul>
    {#each roster.data ?? [] as person (person.id)}
      <li>{person.name}</li>
    {/each}
  </ul>
{/if}
```

`data` is `T | undefined` here, because a one-shot query's result may be a
scalar (`RETURN count(…)`) and there is nothing honest to default it to. If you
only need the rows once and do not need loading state, `{#await db.query("…")}`
is less machinery.

## `<Query>` / `<LiveQuery>` — the same two, in markup

Thin wrappers over `createQuery` / `createLive`: same cache, same refcounting,
same teardown. They exist for when a route would rather say what it renders
than assemble a handle first.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { LiveQuery, Query } from "@surrealdb/analyzer-svelte";
  import { allPeople, liveTeam } from "$lib/queries";
  import { recordId } from "@surrealdb/analyzer-client";
</script>

<Query q={allPeople}>
  {#snippet loading()}<p>Loading…</p>{/snippet}
  {#snippet error(cause, retry)}
    <p>{cause.message}</p><button onclick={retry}>Retry</button>
  {/snippet}
  {#snippet children(people)}
    {#each people as person (person.id)}
      <li>
        {person.name}
        <!-- one live subscription per row -->
        <LiveQuery q={liveTeam.with({ team: recordId(person.team) })}>
          {#snippet children(teammates)}<small>{teammates.length}</small>{/snippet}
        </LiveQuery>
      </li>
    {/each}
  {/snippet}
</Query>
```

(`recordId` ships in `@surrealdb/analyzer-client`. A reactive row is `Json`-shaped, so
`person.team` is the string `"team:red"`, while a record *parameter* has to be
the SDK's `RecordId` to match on the wire — and the table name survives in the
literal type, so `recordId(person.team)` infers `RecordId<"team">` with no
cast.)

`people` and `teammates` carry **no annotation and are still fully typed** — the
row type flows out of `q` and into the snippet parameter, `Rows<R>` unwrapping
and all. `person.nope` is a compile error.

`q` takes what the primitives take: a bound query, a `Preloaded` payload, a
thunk of either (reactive params), or `"skip"`. There is no `q="SELECT …"`
string form — a string in a markup attribute cannot be typed yet, and a prop
that yields `unknown` is not worth the convenience.

Nesting a `<LiveQuery>` per row is the intended pattern, not an abuse of it.
Mounting joins the refcounted cache entry for that key, so rows on the same
query share one `LIVE SELECT`; unmounting drops the last reference and `KILL`s
it immediately. A long list can subscribe to what is on screen and drop the
rest as it scrolls.

Both are separate components rather than `<Query live>`: a flag that changed the
result type is worse to read and worse to type.

**When a snippet is absent.** No `loading` renders nothing — a spinner is your
decision. No `error` **throws**, so the failure reaches `<svelte:boundary>` or
SvelteKit's error page rather than leaving a page silently and permanently
blank. Give it an `error` snippet or catch it:

```svelte
<svelte:boundary>
  <Query q={allPeople}>{#snippet children(people)}…{/snippet}</Query>
  {#snippet failed(cause)}<p>{(cause as Error).message}</p>{/snippet}
</svelte:boundary>
```

`<Query>` renders `children` as soon as it has data — including a `Preloaded`
seed, on the server, on the first paint, with no flash of `loading`.
`<LiveQuery>` waits for its seeding `SELECT`, because its rows start `[]` and an
empty array is indistinguishable from a query that really has none. Its snippet
receives the reconciled **rows**; the live-query `Uuid` is a subscription handle,
not a payload, and is never surfaced.

## The query in the markup

With the preprocessor installed, `q` takes the SurrealQL directly:

```svelte
<LiveQuery q="SELECT id, name, age FROM person WHERE age > {minAge}">
  {#snippet children(people)}
    {#each people as person (person.id)}<li>{person.name}</li>{/each}
  {/snippet}
</LiveQuery>
```

```js
// svelte.config.js
import { vitePreprocess } from "@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte";
import { surrealql-analyzer } from "@surrealdb/analyzer-svelte/preprocess";

export default { preprocess: [surrealqlAnalyzer(), vitePreprocess()] };
```

`{minAge}` is **not** interpolation. Svelte compiles an interpolated attribute
to string concatenation, so without the preprocessor the value would be spliced
into the query text — an injection for a string, and a fresh query text (so a
fresh cache entry) on every keystroke for a number. The preprocessor catches the
attribute ahead of the compiler and captures the parts, so what runs is

```
text    SELECT id, name, age FROM person WHERE age > $__host0
params  { __host0: minAge }
```

One text whatever the value is; a real bound parameter on the wire; a static
skeleton for the registry to key and for `surrealql-analyzer` to analyse. It is
wrapped in a thunk, so it stays reactive through the same `Source` machinery as
everything else.

Forget the preprocessor and nothing misbehaves quietly: the string reaches
`<Query>` at runtime and it throws, naming the two lines to add.

Two things this does not do yet, both external:

- `surrealkit generate` extracts queries from call expressions, not from
  markup attributes, so the skeleton has to reach the registry another way until
  it does.
- `svelte2tsx` — what `svelte-check` and the editor use — applies `script` and
  `style` preprocessors but type-checks the *original* markup, so it sees a
  string here. The snippet parameter needs an annotation until that changes.
  `examples/sveltekit` shows how to derive one rather than write one.

## `createMutation` — a write, and what it invalidates

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { createMutation } from "@surrealdb/analyzer-svelte";
  import { addPerson, allPeople, livePeople } from "$lib/queries";
  import { RecordId } from "@surrealdb/analyzer-client";

  const add = createMutation(addPerson, { invalidates: [allPeople, livePeople] });
</script>

<button
  onclick={() => add.mutate({ name: "ada", age: 36, team: new RecordId("team", "red") })}
  disabled={add.pending}>Add</button>
{#if add.error}<p class="error">{add.error.message}</p>{/if}
```

`mutate` is fire-and-forget (errors land on `.error`); `mutateAsync` returns the
result and throws.

## SSR — `preload`

This is where a named query earns its keep, and it is the one thing `db.query`
cannot do for you.

```ts
// src/routes/+page.ts
import { preload } from "@surrealdb/analyzer-svelte";
import { db } from "$lib/db";
import { livePeople } from "$lib/queries";

export async function load() {
  return { people: await preload(db, livePeople) };
}
```

```svelte
<!-- src/routes/+page.svelte : the query text appears nowhere -->
<script lang="ts">
  import { createLive } from "@surrealdb/analyzer-svelte";
  import type { load } from "./+page";

  let { data }: { data: Awaited<ReturnType<typeof load>> } = $props();

  const people = createLive(() => data.people);
</script>

<ul>
  {#each people.data as person (person.id)}
    <li>{person.name}</li>
  {/each}
</ul>
```

(A real app writes `import type { PageData } from "./$types"`, which SvelteKit
generates as exactly that type.)

The payload carries its own key, text and params, so the component subscribes to
*exactly* the query the server ran. It renders from the seed on the first paint
and upgrades to live in place. Write the text out in both files instead and a
one-byte drift silently discards the seed — no error, no warning, no type
failure. That is the flaw this package was rebuilt around.

Wrap it in a thunk (`() => data.people`) so a client-side navigation that
replaces `data` re-runs it rather than pinning the first payload forever.

## When everything is `any`

Four ways to get `any` with no error on your own code. All four have bitten a
real reader of these docs:

1. **`@surrealdb/analyzer-client` is not installed.** The generated file says
   `declare module "@surrealdb/analyzer-client"`. If the specifier does not resolve,
   TypeScript reports `TS2664` **inside the generated file** — which you would
   never open — and drops the entire registry.
2. **No `lang="ts"` on the `<script>` tag.** Svelte does not typecheck an
   untyped script block at all: `svelte-check` reports *zero errors* on
   `people[0].nope.definitely.not.a.field`. Every snippet above says `lang="ts"`
   because people copy the whole block.
3. **The generated file is somewhere else.** Bare `generate` writes to the
   workspace root, not `src/lib`. If your import says `$lib/surrealql-analyzer`
   and the file is at the root, you now have two of them and they will drift.
4. **You imported `createClient` / `defineQuery` from `@surrealdb/analyzer-client`**
   rather than from the generated file. The augmentation loads with the import.

## Values are JSON here

The reactive layer is `Json<T>`-shaped: a `RecordId` arrives as
`` `person:${string}` ``, a `datetime` as an ISO string. That is what survives
devalue and what `JSON.stringify` produces, so an SSR payload needs no special
handling.

`db.query(…)` and `db.run(…)` outside the reactive layer give the SDK's real
values (`RecordId`, `Date`) instead. The two differ, deliberately: a React
Server Component boundary rejects class instances and has no transport hook, so
uniformity in the other direction is not available.

### If you want SDK classes through `load`

devalue rejects class instances, so `load` cannot return a `RecordId` on its
own. Register the transport hook:

```ts
// src/hooks.ts
export { transport } from "@surrealdb/analyzer-svelte/transport";
```

It covers `RecordId`, `DateTime`, `Duration`, `Uuid` and `Decimal`. Spread it to
add your own:

```ts
import { transport as surrealql-analyzer } from "@surrealdb/analyzer-svelte/transport";
export const transport = { ...surrealql-analyzer, MyType: { encode, decode } };
```

## Sharing a query from a `.svelte.ts` module

The primitives use `createSubscriber`, not `$effect`, so they work outside a
component and tear down automatically:

```ts
// src/lib/people.svelte.ts
import { createLive } from "@surrealdb/analyzer-svelte";
import { db } from "$lib/db";
import { livePeople } from "$lib/queries";

export const people = createLive(livePeople, { client: db });
```

Pass `{ client }` there: `setContext` is only readable during component
initialisation, so a module cannot read it.

## API

| Export | |
| --- | --- |
| `createLive(source, options?)` | live query; `data` is always an array |
| `createQuery(source, options?)` | one-shot; `data` is `T \| undefined` |
| `createMutation(query, options?)` | write + invalidation |
| `<Query q children loading? error? client?>` | `createQuery` in markup |
| `<LiveQuery q children loading? error? client?>` | `createLive` in markup |
| `surrealqlAnalyzer()` (`/preprocess`) | the inline `q="SELECT … {value}"` attribute |
| `preload(db, query)` | SSR payload that remembers its query |
| `setClient(db)` / `useClient(override?)` | context, for the helpers above |
| `dehydrate(db)` / `hydrate(db, state)` | whole-cache transport |
| `transport` (`/transport`) | SvelteKit hook for SDK value classes |
| `Source<Q>` | `Q \| (() => Q \| "skip") \| "skip"` |

Every `create*` accepts `{ client }` as an alternative to context.
`create*` for reactive primitives, `use*` for context — TanStack Svelte v6's
split.
