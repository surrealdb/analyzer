# Diagnostic catalog: categories, codes, and the parameter-constraint channel

Status: implemented (2026-07-10) — every code states the contract it
enforces, and every contract not marked reserved/parser-covered/pending
below is emitting from its analyzer. This is the canonical registry;
codes are assigned here and only here; retired numbers
are never reused.

## Principles (settled in prior rulings)

- **Contracts, not engine behavior.** Every construct has a contract — what
  the author must mean for the statement to make sense. A diagnostic exists
  when the contract is provably violated; whether SurrealDB throws, silently
  tolerates (kind-ordered comparisons), or coerces is *irrelevant to
  severity* — tolerated misuse is the reason this tool exists. One code per
  contract: variations of the same violation are message variants, never new
  codes (operand mismatch is 2004 whether binary, unary, arithmetic, or
  comparison; assignability is 2001 whether the value is a wrong kind or
  NONE).
- **Inference is never affected.** A finding never changes an inferred type.
  Most findings coincide with a perfectly known type (`UPDATE person SET
  age = 'x'` still types as person rows); poison (`Any`) appears only where
  the type is genuinely unknowable.
- **Detection site = emission site.** The analyzer that owns the statement
  emits its findings; composite analyzers learn about inner findings by
  span overlap when they need to.
- **Old validators are removed fully.** Fresh codes, fresh standardized
  messages; the old finding-tests are rewritten per site as it flips.
- **Statically provable only.** Every code below is checkable from source +
  schema. Anything requiring runtime values is out — with one deliberate
  exception: when a value is a *host parameter*, the check is exported as a
  constraint instead of emitted as a finding (see the last section).

## Code scheme

`E`/`W`/`I` prefix in rendering comes from severity, not the code. Codes are
`<family><3 digits>`, families numbered by category:

| Family | Range | Category |
|---|---|---|
| syntax | 0xxx | Parse-level breakage (already emitted by the parser) |
| schema | 1xxx | References to schema objects that don't exist |
| type | 2xxx | Kind mismatches and nullability |
| graph | 3xxx | Relation and traversal misuse |
| statement | 4xxx | Clause and statement misuse |
| function | 5xxx | Function and closure misuse |
| param | 6xxx | Parameter constraints and conflicts |
| lint | 7xxx | Style and suspicious-but-valid constructs |
| compat | 8xxx | SurrealDB version compatibility — gated on the optional `analysis.surrealdb_version` |

Severity defaults: **error** = provably fails or misbehaves at runtime;
**warning** = provably suspicious but executable; **info** = analyzer
limitation or style note.

Severity is the finding's *intrinsic class*; it is data, not policy.
Consumers apply policy at their edge through `PolicyConfig`
(`warnings_as_errors` promotion, per-code allow/warn/deny for lints) —
the CLI for exit codes, the LSP for editor severities, host adapters for
build failures. Errors are never demotable; lints are fully configurable.
(Ruled 2026-07-07; implemented at the CLI and LSP edges.)

In-source suppression is different: a `-- surrealql-analyzer: allow(E1001)
reason="why"` comment is source-authored intent, so it applies at
analysis time, rustc-style — the directive covers the next line (or its
own line when trailing a statement) and a suppressed finding never
leaves the pipeline. Directives that violate their own contract are 7013.

Detection status legend: ✅ inference already computes everything needed
(emission is additive); 🔶 partial (needs modest new analysis at the site);
🔨 needs new analysis machinery (named).

## 1xxx — Schema references

Family contract: **every name a query uses must resolve against the schema,
wherever the schema constrains it.** One code per kind of name; the position
(projection, WHERE, SET, a DEFINE, a RELATE endpoint, a PATCH path) is
carried by the span and message, never by the code.

| Code | Contract | Covers (message variants) | Sev | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1001 | a table reference names a known table | FROM/targets, thin statements, RELATE endpoints, `record<t>` in DEFINE FIELD, relation IN/OUT tables, DEFINE ... ON table | E | ✅ emitting (endpoints/DDL variants pending) |
| 1002 | a field reference names a declared field of its row's table (schemafull only; FLEXIBLE subtrees exempt) | projections, WHERE/expressions, SET/UNSET targets, payload keys, RETURN, OMIT, FETCH, SPLIT, GROUP/ORDER keys, INSERT columns, index/event fields in DEFINE, const PATCH paths | E | ✅ emitting (currently split across 1002-1011; renumbering to 1002) |
| 1012 | a schema-object reference names a known object of that kind | REBUILD/REMOVE INDEX, REMOVE EVENT, the analyzer a `FULLTEXT ANALYZER`/`SEARCH ANALYZER` index names (the engine accepts the definition — verified on 3.2.3 — and fails only when the index is searched), WITH INDEX hints | E | ✅ index/event/analyzer registries in extraction (WITH hints pending grammar support) |
| 1021 | REMOVE removes something that exists | `REMOVE TABLE ghost` | W | ✅ (exists today) |
| 1022 | a definition does not redefine (OVERWRITE/IF NOT EXISTS state the intent) | two `DEFINE TABLE person` — SurrealDB 3.2 *rejects* the second outright, one message per kind: `The table 'person' already exists`, and likewise `field` / `index` / `event` / `function` / `param` / `analyzer` (all seven verified on 3.2.3). Nothing is replaced and nothing is silent, so this is E, not W; `OVERWRITE` (replace) and `IF NOT EXISTS` (keep the first) are the only two spellings the engine accepts | E | ✅ |
| 1023 | FETCH names something that can hold records | `FETCH age` (int); an alias of a computed non-record value | E | ✅ emitting |
| 1024 | SPLIT names a collection field | `SPLIT age` | E | ✅ emitting |
| 1025 | a subfield is declared under an object-shaped parent | `FIELD a TYPE int` then `FIELD a.b` | E | 🔶 |
| 1027 | an index-backed operator has its supporting index | `@@`/search::* need a FULLTEXT index; `<\|k, EF\|>` needs HNSW | E | ✅ emitting |
| 1029 | each index covers a distinct field set | two indexes on `(email)` | W | ✅ emitting |
| 1032 | DEFINE ANALYZER components name known tokenizers/filters/languages | `FILTERS snowball(klingon)` — tokenizer names are parser-covered (the grammar hard-codes them); filter names/languages emit here | E | ✅ emitting |
| 1033 | a DEFINE FIELD clause is one the field it targets accepts, and an index only covers a stored field | `id` rejects VALUE / READONLY / COMPUTED / DEFAULT ALWAYS — the engine fails the definition ("Cannot use the `VALUE` keyword on the `id` field"). `REFERENCE` needs a record type: `TYPE string REFERENCE` fails with "Cannot use the `REFERENCE` keyword with `TYPE string`. Specify only a `record` type, or a type containing only records, instead" (3.2.3); `record<t>`, `option<record<t>>`, `array<record<t>>`/`set<record<t>>` and unions of those are accepted. A plain DEFAULT, TYPE, ASSERT, PERMISSIONS and COMMENT are all accepted on `id`; `in`/`out` were probed against 3.2.3 and have no clause restriction at all. `COMPUTED` excludes DEFAULT/VALUE/READONLY/ASSERT ("Cannot use the `VALUE` keyword with `COMPUTED`"), and a `COMPUTED` field cannot be indexed ("Computed fields cannot be indexed. Index: 'idouble' - Field: 'double'") — a plain `VALUE` field IS stored and indexes fine. Redefining `in`/`out` on a `TYPE RELATION` table is reported as 1022 ("The field 'in' already exists"), since it is that contract | E | ✅ emitting |

Folded by the contract audit (2026-07-09): 1003–1011 → 1002; 1013, 1014,
1030 → 1012; 1015 → 5001 (function resolution); 1016, 1017, 1018 → 1001;
1019, 1020, 1031 → 1002; 1026 → 1001 (source-order effects already make a
removed table unknown); 1028 → 1027.

## 2xxx — Types and nullability

| Code | Contract | Covers (message variants) | Sev | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2001 | a value written to a field inhabits the field's declared type | SET values, CONTENT/MERGE/REPLACE payload values, INSERT tuple values and object payloads, DEFAULT and VALUE clauses in DEFINE, record-link targets (`record<a>` ⊄ `record<b>`), NONE into non-optional (message points at option<>) | E | ✅ emitting (SET/payload/tuple); DEFINE clauses 🔶 |
| 2004 | the operands make sense together for the operator | binary and unary, arithmetic and comparison, compound assignment (`age += 'x'`); SurrealDB kind-ordering instead of throwing changes nothing | E | ✅ emitting |
| 2005 | a condition position expects a boolean | IF conditions, ASSERT clauses, bare non-boolean WHERE | W | ✅ emitting (IF); ASSERT/WHERE 🔶 |
| 2007 | a cast names a known type | `<ghost> x` | E | ✅ emitting (allowlist of engine kind names) |
| 2008 | a conversion can succeed | kind-proven (`<duration> true`, `<record<company>> person:1` where the table sets cannot overlap, `<array> {obj}` / `<object> [1,2]`) or value-proven (`<int> 'abc'`) — the proof strength varies, the contract doesn't. The `type::` constructors are the function spelling of a cast and carry the same code: `type::int('abc')` fails with "Could not cast into int using input 'abc'" exactly as `<int> 'abc'` does, and `type::record('nope')` names no record because a record id has a `:`. The collection/record rows were established by probing 3.2.3 rather than read off the type names — `<array> <bytes>'ab'` really does convert | E | ✅ |
| 2012 | a body returns what it declares | `fn::` `-> string { RETURN 1 }`; closures `\|$x\| -> string { RETURN 1 }` | E | ✅ both halves: fn:: bodies analyzed with params bound; closures |
| 2015 | a value-requiring position gets a value that is always present | `option<int>` field in `x + 1` | W | 🔶 needs the operand rule |
| 2017 | ORDER BY keys name fields available on the result rows (or RAND()) | non-field key; explicit projections not containing the key | E | ✅ emitting |
| 2018 | LIMIT/START take a non-negative integer | wrong kind (via params; literals parse-rejected), negative constants | E | ✅ emitting |
| 2019 | TIMEOUT takes a duration | parser-covered today; emission exists for when params are grammatical | E | ☑ parser-covered |
| 2020 | KILL takes a live-query uuid | parser-covered; grammar-fork bug: `KILL $id` fails to parse | E | ☑ parser-covered |
| 2021 | SHOW SINCE takes a versionstamp or datetime | | E | ✅ emitting |
| 2022 | FOR iterates something iterable | `FOR $x IN 42` — ranges must be modeled first or this false-positives | E | ✅ definite-scalar params; constant-empty iterables → 7004 |
| 2025 | READONLY fields are written only at creation | `UPDATE t SET created = ...` | E | ✅ emitting |
| 2026 | computed (VALUE-clause) fields are not hand-assigned | the write is silently overwritten | W | ✅ emitting |
| 2030 | index/filter/splat apply to collections | `age[0]`, `name[WHERE ..]`, `age.*` | E | ✅ emitting |
| 2031 | a regex literal compiles | `name ~ 'unclosed('` | E | ✅ emitting |
| 2032 | literal content is valid for its kind | `d'2024-13-45'`, `u'not-a-uuid'` | E | ✅ emitting |
| 2033 | PATCH operations are well-formed | unknown op, path without `/`, and an operation missing the key its op needs — every op takes `path`, `add`/`replace`/`test`/`change` take `value`, `move`/`copy` take `from` (each verified on 3.2.3). The engine answers all but the missing-`path` case with `Key 'from' missing`, including an `add` that is in fact missing `value`, so the finding names the key that is really absent and quotes what the engine will print beside it | E | ✅ |
| 2034 | required fields are provided at creation | `CREATE person;` with non-optional, no-DEFAULT `name` | E | ✅ emitting |
| 2035 | DEFINE ANALYZER filter arguments are valid | `edgengram(5, 2)` | E | ✅ emitting |
| 2036 | GeoJSON literals have their declared shape | `{type: 'Pointt', ...}` | E | ✅ emitting |
| 2037 | a field's DEFAULT satisfies its own ASSERT | `DEFAULT 'activ' ASSERT $value IN ['active','inactive']` | E | ✅ emitting |
| 2038 | a constant written to a field satisfies the field's ASSERT | `DEFINE FIELD status ON t TYPE string ASSERT $value IN ['active','inactive']; CREATE t SET status = 'activ'` — the same fold as 2037 with `$value` bound to the written constant, at every constant write (`SET`, `CONTENT`/`MERGE`/`REPLACE`, `INSERT` objects and `VALUES`, `RELATE`, PATCH `add`/`replace`); silent unless the ASSERT folds to `false` outright, and silent when 2001 already rejected the value | E | ✅ emitting |

## 3xxx — Graph and relations

Family contract: **a traversal or RELATE must use relations as declared.**

| Code | Contract | Covers (message variants) | Sev | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3001 | a step traverses a relation table | `->person->` in a chain; a RELATE edge that is a plain table | E | ✅ emitting |
| 3002 | the usage matches the relation's declared shape (`in`->edge->`out`) | wrong-direction traversal, a hop landing off the far side, RELATE writing endpoints on the wrong sides — messages show declared vs written shape | E | ✅ emitting (as 3002/3003/3006; renumbering to 3002) |
| 3004 | a FROM-position chain is complete (edge->target pairs) | `FROM user->writes` | E | ✅ |
| 3009 | a traversal starts from records | `age->writes->` | E | ✅ |
| 3011 | graph recursion is bounded | `@{..}` with no upper bound | W | ✅ emitting |

Folded by the contract audit (2026-07-09): 3003, 3006 → 3002; 3007 → 3001;
3008 → 1001 (an endpoint naming an unknown table is a table-reference
violation); 3010 → 1023 (FETCH's contract). Deleted: 3005 — `->(a, b)` is
*valid*; not resolving it to one table is an analyzer limitation, not a
contract violation.

## 4xxx — Statement and clause misuse

| Code | Finding | Example | Sev | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4003 | ONLY on a table-wide target without LIMIT 1 | `SELECT * FROM ONLY person`, `UPDATE ONLY person` — deterministic runtime error (`SingleOnlyOutput`); CREATE is exempt (always one row) | E | ✅ |
| 4004 | INSERT tuple column/value count mismatch | `(a, b) VALUES (1)` | E | ✅ lowering counts |
| 4005 | BREAK/CONTINUE outside a loop | top-level `BREAK` | E | ✅ loop depth on ctx |
| 4006 | unreachable statements after RETURN/BREAK/THROW | `RETURN 1; SELECT ...` in a block | W | ✅ |
| 4007 | transaction pairing contract: BEGIN opens exactly one transaction that COMMIT/CANCEL closes | unopened COMMIT/CANCEL, nested BEGIN, BEGIN never closed | E | ✅ pipeline tracks the open transaction (nested/unpaired/unclosed variants) |
| 4009 | LIVE SELECT with unsupported clause | `defineLive("SELECT * FROM ticket ORDER BY title")` / `LIMIT` / `GROUP BY` / `START` / `SPLIT` / `OMIT` / `TIMEOUT` / `PARALLEL` / `EXPLAIN` / `ONLY` — every set-shaping clause, which the engine rejects while parsing once the client prefixes `LIVE`; `FROM ticket:1` and a second FROM target, which it registers (answering a uuid) and then never fires. A real `LIVE SELECT` statement only reaches the last two — the grammar admits only projections/FROM/WHERE/FETCH, so the others are a parse error there | E | ✅ verified on a live 3.2.3 over ws://; the contract belongs to the sink (`EmbeddedQuery::live`), so it runs as a post-pass over `defineLive` sources and inside the LIVE SELECT analyzer |
| 4010 | duplicate SET target in one statement | `SET age = 1, age = 2` | W | ✅ assignments are structured |
| 4011 | duplicate projection key/alias | `SELECT age, age FROM t`, two `AS x` | W | ✅ keys computed |
| 4012 | OMIT without a wildcard projection | `SELECT a, b OMIT c FROM t` — the grammar accepts `OmitClause` beside any projection list (the earlier "parser-covered" note was wrong), and the engine applies OMIT to the rows *after* the projection, so without `*` the clause either names a field that is not returned (a no-op) or strips one the list just asked for; either way the fix is to write the projection you want | W | ✅ emitting (nested SELECTs included) |
| 4013 | GROUP BY field not in projections | `SELECT age, count() FROM person GROUP BY name` — 3.x does not run this and does not finish parsing it: `Missing group idiom \`name\` in statement selection`, caret under the projection list (verified on 3.2.3). E, not W. The same code owns a *mistyped* key, because the engine's complaint is about the selection either way and 1002's "the table has no such field" names a defect that projecting the key would not fix; the help says when the key is absent from the source too. `SELECT VALUE`/`*`/`GROUP ALL` and an unparseable projection exempt | E | ✅ |
| 4017 | block ends with LET — its value is NONE | `{ LET $x = f(); }` consumed as a value | W | ✅ block value known |
| 4018 | side-effecting subquery in read position | `SELECT (CREATE log) FROM t` | W | ✅ statement kinds known |
| 4019 | a relation table's rows are made by RELATE / INSERT RELATION, not CREATE / INSERT | `CREATE wrote SET in = user:1, out = post:1` — an edge is a different kind of record, not an ordinary row carrying `in`/`out`, and the engine says so however the payload is spelled: `Found record: \`wrote:v9fh…\` which is not a relation, but expected a RELATION IN user OUT post` (3.2.3; SET/CONTENT, table target or literal id, and plain `INSERT INTO` alike). E, not W — no input makes the statement succeed. `INSERT RELATION INTO` is exempt; `UPSERT` is not covered, because an UPSERT of an existing edge is an update and the engine runs it | E | ✅ verified on a live 3.2.3 |
| 4020 | RETURN mode meaningless for the statement | `CREATE ... RETURN BEFORE` (always NONE) | W | ✅ (verify DELETE/AFTER semantics first) |
| 4021 | SHOW CHANGES on a table without CHANGEFEED | | E | ✅ |
| 4022 | SELECT from a DROP table | rows are never retained | W | ✅ |
| 4023 | count() without GROUP BY yields 1 per row, not a total | add GROUP ALL for a total | W | ✅ |
| 4024 | an IF branch is unreachable — its guard provably folds to a constant | `IF false { ... }`, the ELSE after `IF true { ... }` | W | ✅ constant-folded guard |
| 4025 | a wildcard projection cannot be aggregated by a GROUP clause | `SELECT * FROM t GROUP BY k`, `SELECT * FROM t GROUP ALL`, `SELECT *, count() FROM t GROUP BY k` — 3.0.5 rejects all of them outright (`Incorrect selector for aggregate selection, expression \`*\` … cannot be aggregated in a group`); 2.x silently drops the `*`, so the query never returns what its author asked for under either engine | E | ✅ verified on a live 3.0.5 |
| 4026 | a filtered ONLY has no provable single-row target | `SELECT * FROM ONLY t WHERE status = 'open'` — errors (`Expected a single result output when using the ONLY keyword`) the moment two rows match, but succeeds while one does; W, not E, because the filter may well be single-row for reasons the schema does not state. Silent when at most one row is provable: a record-id target, `WHERE id = …`, an equality covering every field of a `UNIQUE` index, or `LIMIT 1`. Sibling of 4003, which owns the *unfiltered* table-wide case | W | ✅ verified on a live 3.0.5 |
| 4027 | a live query clause the notification will not reflect | `LIVE SELECT DIFF FROM t FETCH owner` — registers, delivers, and leaves the link a record id: the FETCH is silently dead. Also `LIVE SELECT name, DIFF FROM t`, where DIFF has lost its leading position and reads as an ordinary field path, so every notification carries `DIFF: null`. Sibling of 4009, which owns what the engine *refuses*; this owns what it accepts and then does not honour, hence W rather than E | W | ✅ verified on a live 3.2.3 — raw ws:// notification frames, per action (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE) |
| 4028 | an aggregate over a column runs under a GROUP clause | `SELECT math::sum(age) FROM person` — without `GROUP ALL` the call runs per row on a scalar and the engine rejects the argument (`Expected an array`). Only the provable shape fires: every aggregate in the projection over a plain row field whose declared kind is not a collection; `math::sum(tags)` over `array<int>`, a param, or a computed argument is inferred the ordinary way. Silent for `count()`, which 4023 owns; aggregate promotion in inference is gated on a GROUP clause | E | ✅ |
| 4029 | under a GROUP clause every projection is a group key or an aggregate | `SELECT name, count() FROM t GROUP BY city` — the engine does not reject `name`; it silently accumulates every group's values into an array, so the result shape is not what the projection reads as (inference types it `array<string>` to match). Fires for a plain non-key field or an expression over one; silent for `GROUP ALL`, beside a wildcard (4025 owns), and for shapes it cannot prove (subqueries, traversals, methods). Sibling of 4013 (a group key that is not projected) and 4025 (a wildcard) | W | ✅ |
| 4030 | INSERT's RELATION and IGNORE modifiers are in the order the engine parses | `INSERT IGNORE RELATION INTO likes {…}` — the engine's parser eats `RELATION` then `IGNORE` (`syn/parser/stmt/insert.rs`, unchanged since RELATION arrived in 2.0), so the reversed spelling is a parse error pointing at the token after the mistake and naming neither keyword, and no version of SurrealDB ever took it. The grammar accepts both orders on purpose: a parse error is fatal to the whole source. Fires only when both keywords are present and `IGNORE` comes first | E | ✅ verified on a live 3.2.3 — `INSERT RELATION IGNORE INTO likes {…}` inserts, the reverse is a parse error |
| 4031 | a payload `id` names the record the statement targets | `CREATE p:1 CONTENT { id: p:2, … }`, `UPDATE p:1 SET id = p:2`, `UPSERT p:1 MERGE { id: p:2 }` — the row is named twice, differently, and the engine refuses to pick: "Found p:2 for the `id` field, but a specific record has been specified" (3.2.3; CREATE/UPDATE/UPSERT, SET/CONTENT/MERGE alike). Fires only for a literal record id that differs from the target; the same id twice is redundant and silent, a table target (`CREATE p CONTENT { id: p:9 }`) is how a payload chooses its id, and a computed id is not judged | E | ✅ |
| 4032 | ORDER BY/LIMIT/START have more than one row to act on | `SELECT * FROM p:1 ORDER BY n LIMIT 5 START 2` — a single record id is at most one row, so ORDER BY and LIMIT do nothing and START skips the row: engine-verified on 3.2.3, the statement returns `[]`. Silent for a record-id range, a multi-source FROM, a table, `START 0`, and a bare `LIMIT 1` (the harmless belt-and-braces spelling beside ONLY) | W | ✅ |

Folded by the contract audit (2026-07-09): 4008, 4015 → 4007. Deleted:
4014 — no statable contract (RETURN is legal at top level and in blocks).
Deleted (2026-09-08): 4016 — unreachable, `{}` in value position lowers as an
empty *object* literal and a statement-position block's value is never
consumed, so no analyzer site can observe an "empty block"; 4001 — every
clause-on-the-wrong-statement is a parse error in the vendored grammar except
`SELECT … RETURN …`, which the grammar over-accepts and lowering drops, and
that is a grammar-conformance fix (the clause never reaches the AST), not an
analyzer contract. Deleted numbers are retired, never reused.

Renumbered (2026-09-10): the GROUP projection contract was first assigned 4027
on a branch while 4027 was, on `master`, given to the live-notification
contract; the GROUP contract took **4029** at the merge and 4027 stays the live
one. No release carried the GROUP contract under 4027.

## 5xxx — Functions and closures

| Code | Contract | Covers (message variants) | Sev | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5001 | a call resolves to a function that exists | unknown builtins, undefined `fn::`, methods not available on the receiver's kind | E | ✅ emitting (fn:: renumbering from 1015; methods pending) |
| 5002 | a call matches the function's signature | argument count, per-argument kinds (anchored per argument), `fn::` declared params, a closure declaring more parameters than its consumer binds; `rand::int`/`rand::float`/`rand::time` take 0 or 2 arguments (not a `0..=2` range), `rand::duration` requires both bounds; `record::id`/`record::tb`/`record::table` require a `record` argument; `type::table` requires a `string` or `record` argument | E | ✅ emitting (as 5002/5003/5004/5006; renumbering to 5002) |
| 5005 | a const argument satisfies the function's value contract | `type::field('aeg')` naming no field, non-string paths (`type::field(42)`), `type::thing('ghost', ..)` naming no table, out-of-range constants (`math::fixed(x, -1)`) | E | ✅ emitting (path cases); table/range variants 🔶 |
| 5009 | `fn::` definitions terminate (no direct/mutual recursion cycles) | `fn::f` calls `fn::f` | W | ✅ three-color DFS over hoisted signatures |
| 5010 | events do not trigger themselves (directly or in a cycle) | event on `person` THEN mutates `person`; A→B→A | W | 🔨 event-effect graph |

## 6xxx — Parameters

| Code | Finding | Example | Sev | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6001 | conflicting constraints on one param | `WHERE $x > 3 AND $x = 'abc'` | E | ✅ unify at constraint sites; conflict emits at the second site |
| 6002 | param shadows a DEFINE PARAM with a different kind | `LET $min_age = 'x'` vs defined int | W | ✅ fires when the LET value's kind and the DEFINE PARAM's VALUE kind are both known and neither is assignable to the other |
| 6003 | unresolvable dynamic construct (analyzer limitation) | current `dynamic(6001)` class | I | ✅ |
| 6004 | param used before its LET in source order | `RETURN $x; LET $x = 1;` | W | ✅ env is source-ordered |
| 6005 | context param used outside its context | `$before` outside an event, `$parent` outside a subquery | E | 🔶 context-param model below |
| 6007 | assignment to a protected parameter | `LET $auth = {...}` | E | ✅ protected-name list ($auth, $session, $token, $this, ...) |
| 6008 | a param a function body reads is one that something binds | `DEFINE FUNCTION fn::f($parm: any) { RETURN $param; }` — engine 3.2.3 defines it and `fn::f(1)` returns NONE, so the typo is a live logic bug that runs; a did-you-mean offers the declared spelling | W | ✅ declared params + body LET/FOR/closure + DEFINE PARAM (either order) + engine params + enclosing LET |

Deleted (2026-09-08): 6006 (host-declared type contradicts query constraint) —
no emission path exists or is half-built anywhere in `crates/`; the check
belongs to a host adapter comparing its declared binding against the exported
parameter constraints, and the adapter that lands it registers the code it
needs then. A row nothing can emit is a promise the catalog cannot keep.

Retired number (2026-09-11): **6006** stays retired and is not recycled. The
function-body parameter contract added this day took **6008**, the next free
number, rather than filling the 6006 gap. 6006 never had an emission site, but
it was published with its old meaning on the 0.5.3 diagnostics page, so a
reader can have seen it — and a number that means one thing in a published
catalog and another in the next is exactly the ambiguity the
never-reused rule exists to prevent. The gap between 6005 and 6007 is
deliberate; leave it.

| 7006 | a membership test can match | `WHERE x IN []`; `tags CONTAINS 5` against `array<string>` (element kinds that never compare); `tags CONTAINSANY 'x'` — a scalar where a set operator needs a collection: engine-verified on 3.2.3, the ANY/ALL forms are then always false and the NONE forms always true, and the query quietly returns the wrong rows | W | ✅ |

## 8xxx — Version compatibility

`analysis.surrealdb_version` in `surrealql-analyzer.toml` names the release a
workspace deploys against (`"2"`, `"2.2"`, `"3.0.2"`); every check here gates
on it and an unset key is "the latest", which gates nothing. An omitted
component reads as the newest release with that prefix (`"2"` is every 2.x),
the reading with no false positives. The registry is
`crates/workspace/src/analyzer/version.rs`; every row is the diff of
SurrealDB's own `fnc/mod.rs` between release tags (functions) or the presence
of a construct's `sql/*.rs` file at a tag plus the docs' "since"/"removed"
notes (syntax) — the sources are listed in the module docs, and anything
unsourced is deliberately treated as always available.

The same registry is 5001's source of truth for a spelling the current engine
no longer parses: with no target configured, `type::is::record`, `rand::guid`
or `string::startsWith` is "not a known function" carrying the rename (or the
removal) from the table, and nothing else lists removed names. With a target
configured, the same fact is 8001 — one table, one code per situation.

| Code | Finding | Example | Sev | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8001 | every function used exists in the configured target version | added later (`file::get`, `set::len` on a 2.x target — "added in 3.0"), or a spelling the target does not have: `type::is_record` on 2.2 ("before 3.0 it was spelled `type::is::record`"), `type::is::record`/`time::from::millis`/`string::startsWith` on a target past the rename ("renamed to … in 3.0"/"2.0"; the call is still analyzed under its current name), `rand::guid`/`record::refs` on 3.x ("removed in 3.0") | E | ✅ emitting; `time::from::ulid`/`uuid` (the 2.x spellings) dispatch under their current name on a 2.x target instead of false-firing 5001 |
| 8002 | syntax was removed in the configured target version | on a 3.x target: `DEFINE SCOPE`/`DEFINE TOKEN` (→ `DEFINE ACCESS`), `<future>` (→ `COMPUTED`), the fuzzy operators `~`/`!~`/`?~`/`*~` (→ `string::similarity::*`), `SEARCH ANALYZER` (→ `FULLTEXT ANALYZER`), `MTREE` (→ `HNSW`), the bare `<\|k\|>` KNN operator (→ `<\|k, EF\|>` against HNSW, or `<\|k, DISTANCE\|>` brute force) — both absent from the 3.2.3 parser | E | ✅ emitting |
| 8003 | syntax requires a newer version | on a 1.x target: closures, `UPSERT`, `ALTER`, record-id ranges, `?.`, `.{a, b}`, `DEFINE ACCESS`/`CONFIG` (2.0); on 2.0: `.{1..3}` recursion (2.1); on 2.1: `REFERENCE` fields, `<~`, `DEFINE API` (2.2); on 2.x: `COMPUTED`, `DEFINE SEQUENCE`/`BUCKET`, `FULLTEXT ANALYZER` (3.0); on 3.1: `ASSERT`/`DEFAULT` on `id` (3.2). Unsourced and therefore ungated: `??`/`?:` (already in 1.5), `set<T>` kinds (pre-3.0 as deduplicated arrays), `DEFAULT ALWAYS` and the `+path`/`+collect` recursion algorithms (not in the AST), the 3.0 `?.`→`.?` respelling | E | ✅ emitting |

**History (2026-08-08 retired, 2026-09-10 reinstated).** On 2026-08-08 the
family was retired: 8001 and 8003 had been cataloged for a year with no
emission site, gated on a key (`[analysis] surrealdb_version`, then written
into every `surrealql-analyzer init` file with a default of `"2"`) that no analyzer
read, and the reporter on issue #7 cited that key as evidence the tool
targeted SurrealDB 2 — a catalog row and a config default that together
misinformed. Retiring them was right for the tool that existed then.

The reinstatement is a different tool, not a reversal of that judgement: the
version registry above now exists, every row of it is sourced, all three codes
emit and are held to fire/near-miss pairs (`tests/version_contracts.rs`,
`tests/contract_guards.rs`), and the key is *optional* — `surrealql-analyzer init`
does not write it, the README does not show it as a default, and an unset key
means "the latest release", the same claim the retirement made. A key that
gates real checks and defaults to silence cannot be read as a statement about
which release the tool targets; the one that could was the one written into
every file. The "no version axis" argument held only while there was one
target to compare against; a workspace that states it deploys to 2.2 has two.

**After the contract audit (2026-07-09): ~80 contracts across 8 families**
(from 135 rows). Every row states its contract; message variants never get
their own codes; checks that cannot be phrased as contract violations were
deleted. Folded numbers are retired permanently — never reused.

Retired parser-covered number (2026-09-08): **4002** (`SELECT VALUE a, b` —
the grammar rejects a second VALUE projection), verified against the grammar
with `dump_cst`; S0001 covers it, so it has no analyzer emission or registry
entry. 4009 was retired on the same grounds the same day and reinstated at the
2026-09-10 merge: the grammar does cover a real `LIVE SELECT`, but the
contract's owner is the *sink* — `defineLive("SELECT … LIMIT 1")` parses as a
plain SELECT and only becomes a LIVE statement on the client, where the engine
refuses it — so the check exists and the number stays.

## Context parameters

SurrealQL injects parameters by context; treating them as unbound would
both false-positive and forfeit real typing. The analyzer models them as
implicitly bound, with kinds where the context defines them:

| Param | Context | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `$this` | any row scope | current row (table's object type) |
| `$parent` | subquery | enclosing row |
| `$event` | DEFINE EVENT | `'CREATE' \| 'UPDATE' \| 'DELETE'` (literal union) |
| `$before`, `$after` | DEFINE EVENT | the table's row type (`$before` optional on CREATE) |
| `$value` | DEFINE EVENT / FIELD `VALUE`/`ASSERT` | event row / the field's declared type |
| `$input` | DEFINE FIELD | the incoming (pre-coercion) value |
| `$auth`, `$session`, `$token`, `$scope` | permissions / anywhere | session-shaped objects (open) |

Consequences: the unbound-param collector excludes these names; using one
*outside* its context is finding **6005**; inside events, `$before.age`
resolves against the table like any field path. This is also what makes
`DEFINE EVENT`/`ASSERT` bodies fully type-checkable — and it composes:
`$event` being the literal union `'CREATE' | 'UPDATE' | 'DELETE'` means
`WHEN $event = 'CRATE'` (typo) is caught by 7005 (comparison always false)
with no event-specific code needed.

## Inference changes this catalog requires

Small inference upgrades several codes depend on (inference-first rule
still applies — these land before their findings):

- `IF` used as a value without `ELSE` includes `NONE` in its union
  (`LET $x = IF c { 1 }` is `int \| none`) — feeds 2015.
- `Recurse` idiom parts lower structurally (bounds retained) — feeds 3011.
- `ReadonlyClause`/`ValueClause`/`DefaultClause`/`AssertClause` lower on
  DEFINE FIELD — feeds 2009/2010/2011/2025/2026.
- INSERT `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` lowers into assignments — extends
  1004/2001 coverage.
- Index definitions carry their kind (search/vector/unique) in the schema
  index — feeds 1027/1028/1029 and 4013.

**False-positive prevention (correctness of existing rules, found by
checking the operand tables against real SurrealQL):**

- **Temporal arithmetic**: `datetime + duration → datetime`,
  `datetime - datetime → duration`, `duration ± duration → duration`,
  `duration * number → duration` are all valid — the current numeric-only
  arithmetic rule would make 2004 flag them. Both the inference result
  table and `binary_operands_compatible` gain these rows *before* 2004
  ships.
- **Collection concatenation**: `[1] + [2]` is array concat; `+` on two
  objects may merge (research). Same double-table treatment.
- **`<future>` casts**: `<future> { ... }` is not an unknown type — 2007
  would false-positive. Futures type as their inner expression's kind
  (lazily evaluated); needs grammar/lowering support.
- **Record-target assignability**: `record<a>` is assignable to
  `record<a | b>` but not to `record<b>` — `kind_is_assignable_to` gains
  target-set rules before 2001/2027 ship.
- **Compound assignment semantics**: `+=` means push on arrays, add on
  numbers, concat on strings — the 2029 table is also the inference rule
  for the mutated field's continuity.
- **Mock syntax** `|person:1000|` (batch create): grammar support unknown —
  verify; must not lower to a false Partial.
- **Ranges**: `1..5` is a first-class value (`Kind::Range`); `FOR $x IN
  1..5` is valid iteration — 2022 must accept ranges or it false-positives
  on the most common loop form. Range literals need lowering + inference.
- **Membership/geometry operators**: `CONTAINS`/`INSIDE`/`ALLINSIDE`/
  `INTERSECTS` have their own operand rules (string CONTAINS string is
  valid; geometry INTERSECTS geometry) — the 2004 table needs them before
  it ships.
- **Table views** (`DEFINE TABLE x AS SELECT ...`): the view's row type
  derives from its projection — an inference feature; every SELECT check
  applies inside the view definition.
- **Literal text retention**: datetime/duration/uuid literals keep their
  slice so 2032 can validate content and const tracking can carry their
  values.
- **Required-field metadata**: extraction records optionality and DEFAULT
  presence per field — feeds 2034.
- **FLEXIBLE fields**: a `DEFINE FIELD ... FLEXIBLE` object accepts
  arbitrary nested keys — every unknown-subfield check (1004/1005 and
  friends) must exempt paths under flexible fields or it false-positives
  on their intended use.
- **SCHEMAFULL gating**: the unknown-field family fires only on
  SCHEMAFULL tables (or declared fields of schemaless ones) — schemaless
  tables have open rows by design.
- **RELATE fan-out**: `RELATE [a:1, b:1]->likes->c:1` relates arrays of
  endpoints — 3006/3008 must accept record arrays, not just single ids.
- **Geometry subtypes**: `geometry<point>` vs `geometry<polygon>` — the
  assignability rules gain subtype awareness (upstream `Kind::Geometry`
  carries them) before 2001 touches geometry fields.

## Constraint discharge tiers

Every check is discharged somewhere; none are silently dropped. Three
tiers, decided per check by what is knowable where:

1. **Static** — provable from source + schema alone: emitted as findings
   here. (Most of the catalog.)
2. **Host-static** — needs the host's type information, provable at the
   *host's* compile time: exported as constraints; typed adapters (Rust
   macro, TS codegen) fail the build on violation. Example: `$age: int`
   against a host variable typed `string` (6006).
3. **Host-runtime** — the host language cannot prove it statically
   (dynamic JS, values from user input): the adapter emits a guard that
   validates before the query is sent. Example: `type::field($f)` with
   `$f` from a request body — the exported value domain
   (`{"name.first", "name.last", ...}`) becomes a runtime allowlist.

The export format carries enough for all three: kind, value domain,
origin spans (for host-side error messages that point back into the
query), and the discharge tier the analyzer could not achieve.

Future host-combined checks (design placeholders, no codes yet): table
permissions vs host-declared auth scope; record-id shape vs host id
types.

**Access payloads**: `DEFINE ACCESS ... SIGNUP (CREATE user SET email =
$email, pass = crypto::argon2::generate($pass))` defines, implicitly, the
typed signup payload — `$email: string, $pass: string` by the same
constraint collection. Exporting these gives host adapters fully typed
`signup()`/`signin()` calls for free.

## Research before coding (verify against SurrealDB, not docs-from-memory)

- GROUP BY projection rules (what exactly is legal ungrouped) → 4013.
- DDL inside transactions: allowed/atomic? → possible new 4xxx.
- Use-before-DEFINE in one script: runtime order vs our whole-workspace
  extraction → affects 1001/1026 precision.
- LIVE SELECT's exact clause restrictions → settled on a live 3.2.3 over
  ws:// (see 4009 and 4027): the grammar admits only
  projections/FROM/WHERE/FETCH for a real `LIVE SELECT`; `defineLive` strings
  reach the engine as SELECTs and need the post-pass.
- Event cascade semantics (depth limits?) → 5010 severity.
- `+` semantics on arrays/objects (concat/merge?) → temporal/collection
  operand tables.
- `<future>` evaluation semantics and grammar support → futures typing.
- INSERT/CREATE on relation tables: hard error or allowed? → 4019 severity.
- RETURN BEFORE/AFTER exact semantics per statement kind → 4020.
- THROW/RETURN inside transactions (early COMMIT? auto-CANCEL?) → 4xxx.
- ENFORCED relations (3.x): what becomes statically checkable → 3xxx.
- PATCH op validation timing (parse vs runtime) → 2033.

**Deferred design item — multi-database workspaces**: `USE NS/DB`
switches the schema everything after it resolves against. The current
`SchemaIndex` models one database; modeling `USE` means schema scoping
per (ns, db) with source-order switching. Out of scope for diagnostics
v1; queries after a `USE` targeting an unmodeled database degrade to
schemaless behavior (no false positives).

## The parameter-constraint channel (host adapters)

`UPDATE user SET age = $age` must not warn — it must *export*. Every use of
an unbound `$param` in a checkable position produces a **constraint** on
that parameter instead of a finding:

| Usage | Constraint produced |
|---|---|
| `SET age = $age` | `$age: int` (the field's kind) |
| `WHERE age > $min` | `$min: numeric` |
| `string::len($s)` | `$s: string` |
| `fn::greet($n)` | `$n: string` (from the DEFINE) |
| `type::field($f)` | `$f: string` **and** value ∈ table's field paths |
| `FROM $tbl` | `$tbl: table \| record` (domain: known tables) |
| `KILL $id` | `$id: uuid` |

As implemented, the constraint set rides on the exported `ParamInference`
(`crates/workspace/src/analysis.rs`) rather than a separate struct:

```rust
pub struct ParamInference {
    pub name: String,
    pub kind: Option<Kind>,               // unified across constraint sites
    pub domain: Option<ValueDomain>,      // beyond the kind, when known
    pub required: bool,                   // no DEFINE PARAM default
    pub spans: Vec<SourceSpan>,           // every use site
}

pub enum ValueDomain {
    /// Enumerable values (field paths for `type::field`, table names).
    OneOf(Vec<Value>),
    /// Numeric range (`LIMIT $n` → int, `0..`).
    Range { min: Option<i64>, max: Option<i64> },
}
```

Domains compose with kinds: `LIMIT $n` constrains `$n: int` *and*
`n >= 0`; a `LET $n = -1` elsewhere in the script makes the conflict a
static 6001. Hosts discharge domains at their tier — a TS adapter can
narrow `$f` to a string-literal union type, a runtime guard checks the
range.

- Constraints from multiple uses **unify** (intersection); an empty
  intersection is finding **6001** — the query cannot be satisfied by any
  value.
- `AnalysisOutput` carries constraints per source/statement; host adapters
  (Rust macro, TypeScript codegen) enforce them at the call site — `$age`
  must be a number at *the host's* compile time, and `$f` outside
  `{"name.first", "name.last", ...}` fails there too.
- The old kind-only inference was not replaced but extended: constraint
  sites feed `ParamInference.kind`/`.domain` directly, and plain uses
  still record name + span so unconstrained params export too.

## Rollout order

1. Registry plumbing: category enum ↔ `FindingCode` families, message
   templates co-located with codes, one doc-table ↔ code-table consistency
   test.
2. 5xxx (functions) — smallest surface, exercises per-argument spans.
3. 1xxx (schema references) — retires the largest old-validator block.
4. 2xxx (types) — retires assignability/condition/binary validators.
5. 3xxx (graph) — retires graph validators; `semantic.rs` reaches zero
   validators here.
6. 4xxx + the 🔨 items (transaction state, unreachable).
7. 6xxx constraint channel + `ParamInference` retirement.
8. 7xxx lints, behind config (lints default-on but individually
   disableable).

Old-engine note: after step 5, `semantic.rs`, `expression.rs` (node half),
and `select_ir.rs` have no callers and are deleted; `tree-sitter` leaves
the workspace crate's dependencies. That is the doneness check inherited
from the AST migration.
