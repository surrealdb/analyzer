//! Workspace model for the LSP surface.
//!
//! The LSP keeps only document text and delegates analysis to the shared
//! `surrealql-analyzer-workspace` facade. It must not depend on the old analyzer.
//!
//! # Analysis caching
//!
//! Analyzing the whole `.surql` document set is expensive (a full
//! [`analyze_workspace`] pass over every schema and query file). A single
//! keystroke-then-hover used to trigger two or three of those passes:
//! `did_change` publishes diagnostics for every document, and each hover /
//! inlay / go-to-definition re-ran the analysis for the target file. To keep
//! the editor reactive we cache the whole-workspace analysis keyed by a hash
//! of the analysis inputs (every `.surql` document's URI and text). Within a
//! single unchanged document state the pass runs at most once; every
//! subsequent request reuses the cached [`surrealql_analyzer_workspace::WorkspaceAnalysis`]. Any edit
//! (`upsert`) or close (`remove`) changes the key, so the next request
//! recomputes — the cache can never serve analysis that predates the latest
//! edit.
//!
//! # Text is shared, never copied
//!
//! Document text lives in one `Arc<str>` per document. The cache, every
//! per-request result, and the `(source id → uri, text)` map diagnostics use
//! to resolve related spans all hold references into those same allocations,
//! so a request costs pointers, not bytes. This is load-bearing: a workspace
//! of 500 files (2.4 MB of text) used to reach 900 MB resident on
//! `initialized`, because a sweep built one fresh copy of *every* text for
//! *each* document it published.
