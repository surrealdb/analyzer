//! Editor-surface tests: drive the **real** `surrealql-analyzer-lsp` binary over
//! stdio and assert on what an editor would actually receive.
//!
//! Why a second layer on top of `backend.rs`: every regression a user reported
//! recently was invisible to unit tests that assert on internal APIs, because
//! the internal API was right and the editor surface was wrong. These tests
//! spawn the shipped binary, speak framed `Content-Length` JSON-RPC at it, and
//! check hover / inlay hints / completion / diagnostics at specific cursor
//! positions.
//!
//! The handshake is **sequenced** on purpose: `initialize`, wait for its
//! response, then `initialized`, then `didOpen`, then the request. Pipelining
//! these gets "Server not initialized" back from tower-lsp.
//!
//! The server also sends **requests** of its own (`workspace/semanticTokens/
//! refresh`), and tower-lsp numbers those from 0 — the same ids this harness
//! uses for its requests. A message is a response only when it carries an
//! `id` and **no** `method`; matching on `id` alone once took the server's
//! refresh request for the hover response and failed twelve of these tests
//! at once. Like a real editor, the harness answers every server request (a
//! `null` result), so the server is exercised with the protocol it will
//! actually get — unless a test opts out to observe what an unanswering
//! client provokes.
//!
//! Diagnostics are matched on their **version**, never on arrival order.
//! `publishDiagnostics` is not one per notification: a `.surql` file in a
//! workspace root is published by the `initialized` sweep and again by the
//! `didOpen` that follows, and tower-lsp serves messages concurrently, so how
//! many of those spares a later request happens to drain is a matter of
//! timing. A harness that took the next publish for a URI therefore read the
//! *previous* edit's diagnostics whenever one was still in flight — green
//! locally, one failure in CI. Every edit here waits for the publish carrying
//! the version it sent.
