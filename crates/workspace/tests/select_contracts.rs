//! The SELECT clause contracts that depend on the *combination* of clauses:
//! what a `GROUP` clause does to the projections beside it (4029, 4028) and
//! what a page cut without an order is (7016).
//!
//! Each contract gets the query that violates it and at least one near miss
//! that must stay silent — the near misses are the point, since every one of
//! these fires on a shape that is one token away from a correct query.
