//! `Guard` — the predicate IR, and the one function that builds it.
//!
//! Layer 1 answered *what does this expression denote?* This layer answers the
//! second question: **what does this boolean expression claim about it?**
//!
//! Thirteen recognizers spread across `flow/narrow.rs`, `expression/infer.rs`
//! and `data/select.rs` each answer a slice of it — one for `= NONE` on a
//! param, another for `!= NONE` on a row field, a third for
//! `type::table(x) = 'lit'`, a fourth for `type::is_record`, and each with its
//! own idea of which operand orders, which spellings and which polarities
//! count. They agree by accident; `39_composition.surql` and
//! `36_sentinel_spellings.surql` in the corpus record where they do not.
//!
//! [`guard_of`] is the one function, and [`Atom`] the closed set of claims it
//! can produce. Two properties make the collapse work:
//!
//! * **Negation normal form.** `guard_of(e, false)` is `guard_of(e, true)`
//!   negated *by construction*. De Morgan is applied once, here, rather than
//!   in each consumer, so `!(a = NONE OR b = NONE)` and `a != NONE AND
//!   b != NONE` produce the identical guard — which is what makes the two
//!   halves of a `flip_*` pair impossible to get out of step.
//! * **Polarity folded into the atom.** `IsNone` and `IsNotNone` are separate
//!   atoms rather than one atom plus a sign, so refinement is total and no
//!   consumer can forget to flip.
//!
//! What this file does *not* do is decide anything: an atom is a claim, not a
//! kind. Turning a claim into a refinement is [`super::refine`], and it needs
//! the kinds currently in force, which this file never sees.
//!
//! **Prove or stay silent.** Anything not recognized is [`Guard::Unknown`],
//! which contributes nothing. A guard is allowed to be incomplete; it is never
//! allowed to claim something the expression does not say.
