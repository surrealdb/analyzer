//! `LIVE SELECT` statement analysis.
//!
//! The statement's immediate response is the live query's subscription id —
//! a UUID. Its projection, `WHERE` and `FETCH` clauses are the same positions
//! a `SELECT` has, checked under the same contracts by the SELECT analyzer
//! (table and field references, condition types, FETCH targets); only the
//! response differs (the notification rows matter to host integrations, not
//! to the statement's own type). What a *live* query may additionally be —
//! one table, never a record id, and a `DIFF` that honours what stands beside
//! it — is the live contract, checked once here and nowhere else
//! (4009/4027, [`super::live_contract`]).
