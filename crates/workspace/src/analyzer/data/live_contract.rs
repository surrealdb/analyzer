//! What a SELECT may be, when the thing subscribing to it is a live query.
//!
//! `defineLive("SELECT * FROM user:1")` is a plain SELECT to everything that
//! reads it — it parses as one, it types as one, and analysis had nothing to
//! say about it. At runtime the client turns that string into `LIVE SELECT *
//! FROM user:1`, which SurrealDB accepts registering and which then **never
//! fires**. A subscription that silently produces nothing is the failure mode
//! this file exists to stop: there is no error to read, no row to be
//! surprised by, just a feature that does not work.
//!
//! LIVE SELECT is a much narrower statement than SELECT, and the boundary is
//! not documented anywhere we could take on trust, so it was established by
//! sending each form to a live 3.2.3 over `ws://` and reading what came back.
//! `db.query("LIVE SELECT …")` registers the subscription and answers with a
//! uuid; the rejections come back two different ways, which is itself part of
//! the picture:
//!
//! ```text
//! -- accepted, answering with a subscription uuid
//! LIVE SELECT * FROM ticket
//! LIVE SELECT title FROM ticket
//! LIVE SELECT title AS t FROM ticket
//! LIVE SELECT owner.name FROM ticket
//! LIVE SELECT ->owns->ticket AS x FROM person
//! LIVE SELECT VALUE title FROM ticket
//! LIVE SELECT DIFF FROM ticket
//! LIVE SELECT * FROM ticket WHERE title = 'x'
//! LIVE SELECT * FROM ticket FETCH owner
//! LIVE SELECT * FROM type::table('ticket')
//!
//! -- rejected while PARSING: "Unexpected token `X`, expected Eof"
//! LIVE SELECT * FROM ticket ORDER BY title
//! LIVE SELECT * FROM ticket GROUP BY title
//! LIVE SELECT * FROM ticket LIMIT 1
//! LIVE SELECT * FROM ticket START 1
//! LIVE SELECT * FROM ticket SPLIT title
//! LIVE SELECT * OMIT title FROM ticket
//! LIVE SELECT * FROM ticket TIMEOUT 1s
//! LIVE SELECT * FROM ticket PARALLEL
//! LIVE SELECT * FROM ticket EXPLAIN
//! LIVE SELECT * FROM ONLY ticket
//! LIVE SELECT * FROM ticket, person
//!
//! -- rejected while EXECUTING: "Cannot execute LIVE statement using value: X"
//! LIVE SELECT * FROM ticket:1
//! LIVE SELECT * FROM [ticket:1, ticket:2]
//! LIVE SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM ticket)
//! ```
//!
//! The shape underneath: a live query subscribes to a **table**, and every
//! clause it rejects is one that would need the whole result set to evaluate.
//! ORDER BY, GROUP BY, LIMIT, START and SPLIT are all set-shaping, and a
//! notification stream has no set to shape — each change arrives on its own.
//! WHERE and FETCH survive because both are per-row. A record id is rejected
//! for the same reason from the other side: a subscription is to a table's
//! changes, and a single row is not a table.
//!
//! Reported as 4009, whose contract — "LIVE SELECT with unsupported clause" —
//! is exactly this and which had no emission site before.
//!
//! Two rejected forms are deliberately NOT reported through the `defineLive`
//! path, because the SELECT AST does not carry them: `FROM [ticket:1,
//! ticket:2]` has no source node for an array literal (`stmt.from` comes back
//! empty), and `FROM (SELECT …)` reaches here as a subquery whose value is
//! only known at runtime. Both are engine rejections we can see no evidence
//! of, and a check written against a shape the AST never holds is a check
//! that silently never fires. Written as a real `LIVE SELECT` neither form
//! parses at all — the grammar takes only an ident, a record id or a param
//! after `FROM` — so both are already reported there, as syntax errors.
//!
//! # What the engine accepts and then does not honour
//!
//! Registering is not the contract. A notification is computed from the one
//! changed record, not by re-running the query, so a clause can parse, can
//! register, and still not reach the payload. That gap was measured the same
//! way as the rejections — by subscribing over `ws://` to 3.2.3, writing to
//! the table, and reading the raw notification frames. What the payload
//! showed, per clause:
//!
//! - `FETCH` **is** honoured, and resolves at notification time rather than
//!   at registration: `LIVE SELECT * FROM ticket FETCH owner` delivers
//!   `owner` as a full object on CREATE, UPDATE *and* DELETE, and picks up an
//!   edit made to the fetched record in between. A dangling link fetches as
//!   `null`. A `FETCH` naming a non-link or unknown field is silently a
//!   no-op.
//! - `WHERE` **is** honoured, including through a link path
//!   (`WHERE owner.name = 'x'`), on all three actions. Note for callers, not
//!   a defect: there is no "left the filter" notification — a row updated out
//!   of the filter simply goes quiet.
//! - Projections, aliases, computed expressions and `VALUE` **are** honoured,
//!   evaluated against the changed record.
//! - Graph traversals in a projection **are** honoured, with two edges worth
//!   knowing: they are re-evaluated only when the *subscribed* record
//!   changes, so writing an edge fires nothing at all, and on DELETE the
//!   traversal resolves against an already-deleted record and always comes
//!   back empty.
//! - `DIFF` **is** honoured, delivering a JSON-Patch-shaped array. Its
//!   `change` op carries a unified-diff *string* for edited text rather than
//!   the new value.
//!
//! and the two that are not honoured, reported as 4027:
//!
//! ```text
//! -- FETCH is silently ignored under DIFF. Same write, two subscriptions:
//! LIVE SELECT *    FROM ticket FETCH owner
//!    -> {"id":"ticket:a","owner":{"id":"person:bob","name":"bob"},...}
//! LIVE SELECT DIFF FROM ticket FETCH owner
//!    -> [{"op":"replace","path":"","value":{"owner":"person:bob",...}}]
//!
//! -- DIFF is the diff form only in leading position. Later in the list it
//! -- is an ordinary field path, and no table has a field called DIFF:
//! LIVE SELECT title, DIFF FROM ticket
//!    -> {"DIFF":null,"title":"t"}      (on every action, forever)
//! ```
//!
//! Both register, both deliver, and both quietly do something other than what
//! they say — which is why they are a warning rather than an error, and why
//! the message says what the payload will actually contain.
