//! One contract, checked at every position.
//!
//! A position that requires a kind — a field write, a function argument, a
//! `LIMIT`, an `IF` condition — is one assertion: *the value that lands here
//! inhabits `T`*. The analyzer used to spell that assertion once per position,
//! and the spellings disagreed on five independent axes: whether a written
//! constant is compared as the literal it *is* or as the kind inference
//! widened it to, whether a union distributes, where the `any` short-circuit
//! sits, what an unbound `$param` does, and whether the position is checked at
//! all. `DEFINE FIELD e ON t TYPE 'red' | 'blue' VALUE 'green'` was silent for
//! exactly that reason while `CREATE t SET e = 'green'` reported — one rule,
//! two implementations, one of them wrong.
//!
//! This module is the rule. [`Position`] enumerates every place in SurrealQL
//! that demands a kind, [`Contract`] pairs the demand with the finding it
//! raises, and [`decide`] is the only decision.
//!
//! ## Prove or stay silent
//!
//! [`Verdict`] is three-valued because the policy is. An error-severity
//! finding aborts code generation for a whole workspace, so a check that fires
//! on a value it cannot see is worse than a check that misses one it can:
//!
//! * [`Verdict::Violated`] — *proven* not to inhabit the contract. Emit.
//! * [`Verdict::Satisfied`] — proven to inhabit it. Silent.
//! * [`Verdict::Unknown`] — neither. Silent, deliberately: an `any`, an
//!   unbound `$param`, a call whose result the analyzer does not model.
//!
//! That is why a bare `string` written into a `'red' | 'blue'` field is
//! *accepted*: inference widens a written `'red'` to `string`, so the widened
//! kind carries no evidence about which string it holds. The evidence lives in
//! the *value*, and [`checked_kind`] is what recovers it.
