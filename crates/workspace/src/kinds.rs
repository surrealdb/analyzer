///
/// This is THE projection policy. Every "what is `value.field`" question in
/// the crate — a schema sub-path, an idiom walk, a hover, a destructure, a
/// projected-row oracle — asks it, so the answer cannot drift between sites.
/// The rules, in the order they apply:
///
/// * **`any` projects to `any`.** An unknown value has an unknown member, not
///   a provably absent one.
/// * **A union projects arm by arm.** The `NONE`/`NULL` arms are set aside;
///   every other arm is projected, arms with no such member are dropped, and
///   the survivors are unioned in arm order (order is load-bearing for
///   rendering — see `lattice::canonical_union`). No survivor → `None`. When a
///   sentinel arm was set aside the result is `option<…>` of that union: a
///   value that may be `NONE` has a member that may be `NONE`
///   (`option<record<user>>.name` is `option<string>`). The sentinel comes
///   back as `none`, the shape [`rewrap_kind`] gives [`KindWrapper::Optional`].
/// * **A record link reads the schema.** Each target table contributes what
///   [`crate::analyzer::data::select::kind_for_path`] says the field is
///   (declared, refined, a nested-object prefix, or the implicit
///   `id`/`in`/`out`); tables without the field are dropped and the rest are
///   unioned. A target the schema does not know, an unconstrained `record<>`,
///   or no schema at all (`schema: None`) leaves the member unprovable →
///   `None`. A record has no `Element`.
/// * **A collection distributes.** `Element` is the element kind itself; a
///   `Field` step projects the ELEMENT and wraps the result back in the same
///   collection with the same length (`array<record<user>>.name` is
///   `array<string>`) — SurrealQL's implicit `[*]` on field access.
/// * **A literal object is read by key**; it has no `Element`.
/// * **Everything else** — a scalar, an open `object`, a geometry, a tuple
///   literal, a `table<>` — proves no member: `None`. An open `object` is
///   deliberately *not* `any` here: it says nothing about its keys, so this
///   never invents one, which keeps "does this path exist on the table"
///   checks honest.
