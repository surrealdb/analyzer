//! The watch loop behind `surrealql-analyzer watch` and `check --watch`.
//!
//! A report goes stale silently: you edit a `.surql` file or a host file and
//! nothing re-runs. Watching closes that loop — run once, then re-run on every
//! change to an input the analysis actually consumes.
//!
//! # Output
//!
//! See [`report`]. The short version: a watch is a display of the workspace's
//! current state, not a log of its history, so each run repaints the screen
//! rather than scrolling the last one away, and the verdict is a coloured band
//! that reads as PASS or FAIL without being read.
//!
//! # What is watched
//!
//! Exactly the inputs `check` reads:
//!
//! * every `.surql` / `.surrealql` file under the workspace root,
//! * every host file ([`crate::is_host_source`]: `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.js`/`.jsx`/
//!   `.svelte`/`.vue`/`.astro`) — the files
//!   [`crate::discover_host_sources`] scans for embedded queries,
//! * `surrealql-analyzer.toml` itself, because a config change alters which files
//!   matter and how findings are graded.
//!
//! Everything the config's `[sources] ignore` covers is dropped — twice over:
//! ignored top-level directories are never handed to the watcher at all (so
//! `target/`, `node_modules/` and `.git/` cost nothing), and every delivered
//! event is re-checked against the ignore patterns before it can trigger a run.
//!
//! # Debounce
//!
//! One editor save is several filesystem events, and an atomic-save editor adds
//! a create/rename/remove burst on top. Two layers collapse that into one run:
//! `notify-debouncer-full` merges raw OS events over a [`DEBOUNCE`] window and
//! tracks renames by file id, and [`coalesce`] then keeps draining the
//! debouncer's own output while batches keep arriving inside the same window —
//! a save whose events straddle two debouncer ticks still yields exactly one
//! re-run. [`coalesce`] is a pure function over a channel, which is what makes
//! the coalescing testable without sleeping on real filesystem events.
//!
//! # Failure
//!
//! A run that fails reports and the loop keeps going. Typing a syntax error
//! must not kill the watcher — the next save is the fix.
