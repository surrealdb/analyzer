  // A query text the registry does not contain is a hard error carrying its own
  // remedy, not a silent degrade to `unknown[]`:
  //   Argument of type 'SurqlError<"this query is not in the generated
  //   registry - run `surrealkit generate`">' is not assignable to …
  //
  // That guarantee CANNOT be demonstrated here, and the reason is worth stating.
  // `surrealkit generate` extracts every `defineQuery` / `defineLive` literal
  // in this project, so any query written in this file is, by construction, in
  // the generated file. A registry miss is therefore only ever a *stale*
  // registry — and an example that regenerates cleanly is exactly one that
  // cannot hold a stale one. (Reflowing a literal is the same thing: it changes
  // the key, so it errors until the next `generate`, which then picks the new
  // text up.) The guarantee is proven where the registry is hand-declared and
  // no tool rewrites it: `packages/client/test-d/query.test-d.ts`.
  //
  // What IS demonstrable is the deliberate opt-out, for a genuinely dynamic
  // query that no generated file could ever contain:
  const dynamic = defineQuery.unchecked(`SELECT * FROM ${"person"}`);
  const rows = await db.run(dynamic);
  // It degrades to `unknown[]` — never `any`, so the rows stay unusable until
  // you narrow them yourself, and nothing silently typechecks.
  // @ts-expect-error the row is `unknown`, so nothing can be read off it.
  rows[0]!.name;
